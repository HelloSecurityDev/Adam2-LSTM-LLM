# Adam2-LSTM-LLM
a python based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Language Model (LLM) named Adam2

This project implements a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Language Model (LLM) named Adam2. The model is trained on a dataset of movie dialogs to generate text based on user input. The project includes a GUI interface for interacting with the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.0 or higher
- tkinter
- numpy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your/repo.git

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow tkinter numpy

3. Launch the script:
   ```bash
   python Adam2.py

## Usage
Load and preprocess the dataset:
```bash
The dataset used for training the model is the Cornell Movie Dialogs Corpus. The dataset will be automatically downloaded and extracted.
```
Define and train the LSTM model:
```bash
The model architecture consists of an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense layer. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
```
Generate text using the trained model:
```bash
The generate_text function takes a trained model, tokenizer, maximum sequence length, seed text, and number of words to generate as input. It generates text by predicting the next word based on the seed text.
```
GUI Interface:
```bash
The project includes a GUI interface for interacting with the model. The interface allows users to enter text and receive responses generated by the model.
```
